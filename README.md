# Module Federation Karma Example
This is an example repository setup to recreate an error combining Karma and Module Federation together in tests. 


To start the federated module in the federated folder run
```
npm run start
```


In the platform folder run
```
npm run test
```

or

```
npm run test:watch
```

In the Karma console and the browser instance of Karma you should see the webpack error.
